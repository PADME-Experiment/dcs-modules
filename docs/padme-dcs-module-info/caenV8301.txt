CAEN V8301 (NIM Crates)

padme-dcs reads via caenvme library - calls slightly modified 
by me following caen user manual - the following from the V8301 NIM Crates:


1) Timestamp of the callout from l0padme1 	       (timestamp)
2) NIM crate name					(text)
3) IP address						(text)
4) MAC address of the unit being read 			(text)
5) channel number  (6)	      	   	 		(int)
6) fanspeed (int from 0 to 3)				(int)
7) monitor_fan1  (rpm)	   				(uint32)
8) monitor_fan2  (rpm)	   				(uint32)
9) monitor_fan3  (rpm)	   				(uint32)
10) fu temp       (C degrees)				(double)
11) ps temp	  (C degrees)				(double)

then for each voltage channel (6)  we have the readout of :
The voltages are fixed for each channel - nor value nor limits can be set
	
1) number of channel (1-3)				(int)
2) name of mon channel					(text)
6) vmon - actual voltage read				(double)
7) iset - set voltage standard				(double)
8) imin - for alarm   					(double)
9) imax - for alarm					(double)
10) imon - actual voltage read				(double)


all quantities are available from padme-dcs as vales as apecified above
