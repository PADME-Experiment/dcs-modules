The readout of the PADME ambient parameters come from a series of DHT22
temperature and humidity sensors hooked in the back of PADME Ecal to 
monitor the temperature and humidity inside the black metal cap 
beyond the ECAL which houses all PMTs and partitors (heating thus
the box) which is used to light-shield the crystals and PMTs.

In principle there should be (at least) 9 sensors house in the box in the 
following way :


          -----------------------
	  |x	    x          x|
	  |			|
	  |			|
	  |x	    x          x|
	  |			|
	  |			|
	  |x	    x	       x|
	  -----------------------


The sensors are read by a Raspberry Pi 3 DHCP-enabled on the DCS subnet
and each one is read for temperature and relative humidity.
The raspberry calculates and outputs also the dew point.

The readout is input then to a memcached server running on the raspberry
with the timestamp of the start of the measurements each 10 seconds with
key name PadmeAmb.

padme-dcs module DrvPadmeAmb interrogates the memcached server of 
the raspberry pi 

The memcached response is thus :
1) Timestamp				(text)
2) number of sensors being read		(int)

then for each channel being read we have :

3) gpio port of the read channel	(int)
4) temperature (C degrees)		(double)
5) relative humidity (%)		(double)
6) dew point  (C degrees)		(double)
