The readout of the BTF ambient parameters come from a COMET T7510 unit :
Intelligent barometric pressure, humidity and temperature probe with Ethernet interface

The object is located inside the BTF hall and has an IP address
http://192.168.189.180/
where its http interface responds.

Upon interrogation of
 http://192.168.189.180/epocasi.html
you get a string as the following :

Local PC time: 7/26/2018, 3:19:01 PM 24.9 55.5 987.3 

where the last 3 numbers are : Temp (C), relative humidity (%) and pressure (hPa)
from which you can calculate the dew point evenctually

The padme-dcs module DrvBTFAmb gets these numbers from the above html and 
converts them to the appropriate double values with the timestamp of when
it was called by l0padme1.
