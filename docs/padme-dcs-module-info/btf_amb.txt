The readout of the BTF ambient parameters come from a COMET T7510 unit :
Intelligent barometric pressure, humidity and temperature probe with Ethernet interface

The object is located inside the BTF hall and has an IP address
http://192.168.189.180/ where its http interface responds.

Upon interrogation of
 http://192.168.189.180/epocasi.html
you get a string as the following :

Local PC time: 7/26/2018, 3:19:01 PM 24.9 55.5 987.3 

where the last 3 numbers are : Temp (C), relative humidity (%) and pressure (hPa)
from which you can calculate the dew point evenctually

The padme-dcs module DrvBTFAmb gets these numbers from the above html and 
converts them to the appropriate double values with the timestamp of when
it was called by l0padme1.
All fields are separated by ; character

The data are then written inside the file padme-dcs/data/BTFamb
example:
Wed Oct 10 12:03:33 2018;23.500000;52.099998;996.799988
