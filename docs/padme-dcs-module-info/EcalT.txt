 The Ecal has 40 Pt1000 thermocouples embedded with the crystals which are being read
 by a KeySight 34972A Ethernet enabled unit (LXI).
 The unit has 2 x 20 channel multiplexed resistance  sensing modules to read all 40 channels.

 The readout via ethernet has to be done via LXI SCPI custom commands on the Keysight socket opened
 inside padme DCS.
 The units independently scans (within ~10 seconds) all 20 channels allocated on each module 2 times and sends
 the scan result to the inquiring program.

 The DrvEcalT module reads the output buffer and decodes the relevant informations per each
 channel.

 At the end we get per each channel an output of the form :
 channel number        (int : 101 to 120 - 1.st module ; 201 to 220 - 2.nd module)
 temp in C degrees     (float : example = 25.745000 )
 error code            (int - 0 means OK )  
 readout timestamp     (ex : 17-9-2018 18:57:50.712000 as recorded by keysight clock- set at the actual CEST time)

 The module gets the full list of all channels and can output it to the control DeCeSe program.
